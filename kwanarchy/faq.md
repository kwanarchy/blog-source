Anarchism, despite initial reactions, is not the political philosophy of throwing bombs, setting things on fire, or destroying property without reason. Instead, anarchy is the philosophy that all unjust hierarchies must be abolished in favour of a linear, equal society in which no person is above another. Subsequently, anarchists work towards a completely voluntary society in which everyones thoughts within the community are accounted for, as well as no person holding any meaningful power over another.
