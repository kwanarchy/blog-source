Hello! Welcome to our blog. Here we'll post poster designs for anyone to use. We'll also make posts about leftist topics in order to help educate people.

We're a duo based in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, and our goal is to help educate people on leftist (predominantly) thought and ideals, as well as hopefully starting a movement in the region. 

The seeds of anarchy are sown through social change!
